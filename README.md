# 📖 TestQuran — Interactive Quran Memorization Practice

**TestQuran** is a web application designed to help **Quran memorization students** test and strengthen their memorisation.  
Inspired by **traditional testing methods used by sheikhs**, it provides a modern, interactive way to practise recalling verses using audio, visual aids, and structured tests.

## 🧩 Project Overview

**TestQuran** focuses on two main modes of revision:

### Practice Mode
- Select a **custom verse range**
- Generate a **random verse** to test memorisation
- Recall the next verses before revealing them
- Access verse context, audio recitation, and the original Quran page image

### Test Mode
- Create structured tests with a chosen range and number of questions
- Attempt recall, reveal answers, and mark them as correct or incorrect
- Review results at the end to identify verses needing more practice

This mirrors traditional memorisation testing, with the flexibility of a web app.
